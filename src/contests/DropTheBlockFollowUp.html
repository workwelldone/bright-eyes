		<h1>Drop The Block Follow Up</h1>
		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
		<p>This was a fun game!  It was fun having such an interesting problem to solve, playing against other players, and gaining valuable practice.</p>
		<h3>Evaluation of overall solution algorithm</h3>
		<p>I think the overall algorithm worked very well!  I went into the solution without knowing for sure how much the computer could handle.  It was a brute force solution, but with maximum flexibility and potential.  It turned out that considering all possibilities of 5 blocks in advance was too much in 100 ms, but considering 4 blocks was optimal.</p>
		<p>I wanted to further test and refine algorithm score results, but I ran out of time.  After reaching the gold level, I learned how the scoring worked.  The algorithm could have easily incorporate scoring weights, which could have further improved performance.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>I will definitely sign up for the next contest!  I look forward to improving every day.  I hope I can become a valuable addition to a team of great people.  Thanks again to the people at codingames.com!</p>
